                        <p>The purpose of this video is to show how gay people struggle with the world around them, and how the support of just one person can help.  The video attempts to achieve it's purpose by having a gay man tell the story of his pain by his uncle killing himself.  The structure of the message is a letter that he wrote to his uncle.  This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences project because it was told in the point of view of the nephew, and it makes it much more personal.</p>
