                        <p>The purpose of this video is to show how gay people struggle with the world around them, and how the support of just one person can help.
                        The video attempts to achieve it's purpose by having a gay man tell the story of his pain by his uncle killing himself.  
                        The structure of the message is a letter that he wrote to his uncle.  This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences project
                        because it was told in the point of view of the nephew, and it makes it much more personal.</p>
                        <h2>Blog #2</h2>
                        <p>Today in class we watched an episode of South Park. To be honest I have never actually seen an episode before, but it was funny and
                        entertaining and I'm glad I watched it.  It was about World of War Craft, and how they kept getting killed so they spent all of their time
                        leveling up, and it ended up barely even mattering when they were finished.  Yes other player could start playing again, but all that happend
                        to them was that they got fat, and gross.  Video games are fun but only in moderation.
