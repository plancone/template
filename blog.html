                                <p>The purpose of this video is to show how gay people struggle with the world around them, and how the support of just one person can help.
                        The video attempts to achieve it's purpose by having a gay man tell the story of his pain by his uncle killing himself.  
                        The structure of the message is a letter that he wrote to his uncle.  This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences project
                        because it was told in the point of view of the nephew, and it makes it much more personal.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #2</h1>
                                <p>Today in class we watched an episode of South Park. To be honest I have never actually seen an episode before, but it was funny and
                        entertaining and I'm glad I watched it.  It was about World of War Craft, and how they kept getting killed so they spent all of their time
                        leveling up, and it ended up barely even mattering when they were finished.  Yes other players could start playing again, but all that happend
                        to them was that they got fat, and gross.  Video games are fun but only in moderation.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #3</h1>
                                <p>Research papers. Ugh. Today I began research for my paper.  We have to write a research paper on our major, so for me it's criminal justice.
                        To be honest, I'm not looking forward to writing this paper at all.  I already have to write one for my Sociology class, so now I have two papers
                        to write over spring break. Good thing I'm not going anywhere besides my couch.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog #4</h1>
                                <p>The Chrysler ad that we watched in class gives me chills every time it comes on.  It encorperates images of Detroit, the song Lose Yourself by Eminem, and the slogan
                        Imported From Detroit.  The purpose of this ad is to show that yes the city of Detroit has gone through some difficult times, and no this city is not
                        like any other big city in our country, but it does know luxury.  It shows that Detroit knows hard work, and it is capable of making an amazing car.  It says
                        Imported From Detroit because unless you live in or around Detroit, you do not know anything about the city.  You only assume what you have seen in the news paper
                        is all you need to know about the city, and this ad proves that assumption wrong.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog #5</h1>
                                <p>I am finally relieved.  After finally finishing my research paper relief finally hit.  It was very stressful, and I struggled getting getting the paper finished, but in the end it was completed.  It made my spring break a miserable experience, but I feel that I did a pretty good job writing it.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #6</h1>
                                <p>Today we are turning in our proposal for the Remix Project.  My group so far has done a very good job dividing the work, and getting everything done.  This week we are going to be researching videos, pictures, and interviews to use in our own documentary.  I feel like we will easily be able to get this completed.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #7</h1>
                                <p>Throughout this week I have been researching videos and clips to use in my groups documentary.  I really like the texting and driving commercials and hope we are able to encorporate them into our own project.  I like them because they leave such a strong impact on me when I watch them.  Hopefully the rest of my group is also researching so we can get this project finished quickly.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #8</h1>
                                <p>As I researched video clips for our documentary today, I found some interesting videos I think we can use.  I watched many texting and driving commercials that always make me upset when I see them.  I do not understand how people could risk not only their own lives, but everyones lives as they decide to use their phones while on the road.  I just wish people would think more deeply about their actions before they decide they are going to drive while distracted.  It can wait.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #9</h1>
                                <p>While trying to find the inspiration to write my first assignment in this class I struggled.  I always knew that I wanted to go into criminal justice, but in order to connect it to a specific piece of technology I had to dig deep.  I was then able to really think about the events in my life that lead me into the direction I'm currently walking, and I realized that September 11, 2001 was the reason why I chose criminal justice.  After completely understanding what was asked of me, and having my own idea, it was very simple to complete the lived experiences assignment.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #10</h1>
                                <p>While choosing the topic I was going to use for my Cultural Analysis project I decided to think a lot about something that caused a major social issue that affects me.  In class we watched the south park video, and that didn't really apply to me very much because I don't play video games.  I ended up choosing cell phones because I use my phone all the time, and I found it the most interesting.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #11</h1>
                                <p>About a week ago I finally finished Codecademy.  It took almost all of the semester, and at times was a lot of work.  I found it interesting because I never knew how much went into making websites and other things.  Codecademy however was very frustrating because if you got a part in the code wrong it wouldn't tell you exactly which part, which led to a lot of swearing and wondering where I messed up. I eventually figured it out, and relief would take over.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #12</h1>
                                <p>Today a member of my group and I met in Brody to interview people for our documentary.  We asked, if I remember correctly, 4 people several questions that we hope to encorporate into our video.  We also shot some scenes of people using their cell phones because people are never without their phones, and capturing people using their phones will be beneficial to our video.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #13</h1>
                                <p>Our group is having some difficulties.  We are not able to communicate very well and two group members are constantly arguing.  Our fourth member still has yet to do anything, and I really hope that we are able to finish this project in time because I really hope to receive a good grade on the project.</p>
                        <h1>Blog #14</h1>
                                <p>We only have one WRA class left.  It's so surreal how quickly not only this semester, but my entire freshman year has flown by.  We are now working on our last project, and I already completed the draft that we needed to do.  I'm so excited to be free from school for months, but at the same time I will miss my friends so much.</p>
                       <h1>Blog #15</h1>
                                <p>As I sit on my couch next to my sister on Easter Sunday, all I can think about is how I am approaching my last full week of classes, and my last two weeks of school.  It has been an amazing freshman year, and I'm so happy I got to spend every minute of it with my best friends.  Can not wait to come back to MSU in the fall with all new classes.</p>
