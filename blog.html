                        <p>The purpose of this video is to show how gay people struggle with the world around them, and how the support of just one person can help.
                        The video attempts to achieve it's purpose by having a gay man tell the story of his pain by his uncle killing himself.  
                        The structure of the message is a letter that he wrote to his uncle.  This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences project
                        because it was told in the point of view of the nephew, and it makes it much more personal.</p>
                        <h2>Blog #2</h2>
                        <p>Today in class we watched an episode of South Park. To be honest I have never actually seen an episode before, but it was funny and
                        entertaining and I'm glad I watched it.  It was about World of War Craft, and how they kept getting killed so they spent all of their time
                        leveling up, and it ended up barely even mattering when they were finished.  Yes other players could start playing again, but all that happend
                        to them was that they got fat, and gross.  Video games are fun but only in moderation.</p>
                        <h3>Blog #3</h3>
                                <p>Research papers. Ugh. Today I began research for my paper.  We have to write a research paper on our major, so for me it's criminal justice.
                        To be honest, I'm not looking forward to writing this paper at all.  I already have to write one for my Sociology class, so now I have two papers
                        to write over spring break. Good thing I'm not going anywhere besides my couch.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Blog #4</h4>
                                <p>The Chrysler ad that we watched in class gives me chills every time it comes on.  It encorperates images of Detroit, the song Lose Yourself by Eminem, and the slogan
                        Imported From Detroit.  The purpose of this ad is to show that yes the city of Detroit has gone through some difficult times, and no this city is not
                        like any other big city in our country, but it does know luxury.  It shows that Detroit knows hard work, and it is capable of making an amazing car.  It says
                        Imported From Detroit because unless you live in or around Detroit, you do not know anything about the city.  You only assume what you have seen in the news paper
                        is all you need to know about the city, and this ad proves that assumption wrong.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Blog #5</h5>
                                <p>I am finally relieved.  After finally finishing my research paper relief finally hit.  It was very stressful, and I struggled getting getting the paper finished, but in the end it was completed.  It made my spring break a miserable experience, but I feel that I did a pretty good job writing it.</p>
                        <h6>Blog #6</h6>
                                <p>Today we are turning in our proposal for the Remix Project.  My group so far has done a very good job dividing the work, and getting everything done.  This week we are going to be researching videos, pictures, and interviews to use in our own documentary.  I feel like we will easily be able to get this completed.</p>
                        <h7>Blog #7</h7>
                                <p>Throughout this week I have been researching videos and clips to use in my groups documentary.  I really like the texting and driving commercials and hope we are able to encorporate them into our own project.  I like them because they leave such a strong impact on me when I watch them.  Hopefully the rest of my group is also researching so we can get this project finished quickly.</p>
                        <h8>Blog#7</h8>
                                <p>As I researched video clips for our documentary today, I found some interesting videos I think we can use.  I watched many texting and driving commercials that always make me upset when I see them.  I do not understand how people could risk not only their own lives, but everyones lives as they decide to use their phones while on the road.  I just wish people would think more deeply about their actions before they decide they are going to drive while distracted.  It can wait.</p>
