			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>The chances of the solution to the loss of communication skills, by having people stop texting and start talking to be completely effective, is highly unlikely.  People rely heavily on their phones, and it will be very difficult for people to change.  It is almost like an addiction.  Schools that do not allow phones to be used during class hours is in theory a great idea to help regulate cell phone usage if it was actually effective.  At my high school we were not supposed to use phones at all, and yet I used mine every day and I never got in trouble for it.  In order for this approach to be successful at all it needs to be enforced.  Some teachers were very strict and others would absolutely care less about you using your phone during class, but that is why it is unsuccessful.  All of the adults need to get on the same page to give students the tough love they need to stop relying on technology, and their cell phones in particular, during all hours of the day.  Amongst these adults who need to be ready for some tough love are the parents of kids who overuse their cell phones on a daily basis, and all parents in general.  Of course many parents are concerned with the amount of time their kids spend on their cell phones daily, but they also like the convenience factor of the children carrying around their own phone because they can easily access them.  Parents need to be ready to enforce the rules even if it means grounding your child from their phone.  I realize that technology is the present and most likely the future of our country, and that every single person’s social skills cannot possibly be fixed by communicating face to face more, but if people would engage in face to face conversation or even just talking on the phone more often than they do now, interpersonal and communication skills in my generation would improve.</p>
