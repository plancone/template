			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The field of criminal justice relies on research to shape and influence an ever changing, complex system. The criminal justice system is comprised of local and federal agencies and the processes established by these institutions to monitor and control crime through imposing penalties on people who break set laws.  The criminal justice system in the United States is composed of many similar, individual systems.  The criminal justice system works in accordance to the jurisdiction that the charge is established in: city, county, state, federal or tribal government or military installation.  The trend within the criminal justice system is to use Evidence Based Decision Making (EBDM) to help these local and federal agencies create judicial policies within these areas.  EBDM is obtained through current and credible research collected from a variety of sources.  These sources include verbal and non-verbal communications observed and recorded in both law enforcement officials, and criminals/potential criminals.  There are many supporting technologies within the field of criminal justice.  Law enforcement officers use cars, cell phones, laptops, and other devices to create cases, conduct surveillances, and to make arrests.  Technology is then used to gather and collect data about these arrests in the subsequent hearings, sentencing, and incarcerations of these criminals.  The data is then analyzed to look for trends and patterns in targeted areas of research.  Using this information, local and federal agencies trying to implement EBDM have adjusted policies and practices.</p>
