			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Cell Phones were invented by Martin Cooper, and ever since they have captivated and been the main source of communication among people.  Cell phones possess many positive qualities, but they also are a major cause of the loss of interpersonal skills among youth.  In order to fix this major issue people need to stop texting and start calling and talking face to face again.  This will be very difficult for everyone to be able to do, but if our society wants people to keep their interpersonal skills then it is necessary for us to consider the effects on society if most people are not able to communicate with the people around them.</p>
