			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>There is one main proposal on how to fix this social issue caused by cell phones.  People need to stop texting and start talking again.  These are all good solutions to help kids so that they do not lose important communication skills.  Yes this is easier said than done, to stop texting and start talking, because people rely so heavily on the use of their phone, but we need to start strongly encouraging that phones are not constantly used at everyday social events like waiting in line, hanging out at a party, sitting at dinner, and during school.  The fact that parties have turned into people sitting or standing next to each other and everyone checks their phone every 6 seconds is just sad.  Parties should definitely not need to be given tips for solutions to solve the unsocial aspect of them.  It is a party, and parties are meant to be social events.  If you do not want to go to a party to talk and meet new people, then do not go to the party.  It is as simple as that.  Further, most schools discourage cell phone usage by making them not allowed, and students get punished for using them during school hours.  When teenagers get home from school an interesting way to discourage phone usage at the dinner table is to put all the phones in the middle, and the first person to touch theirs has to do dishes, or buy the dinner or whatever!  The biggest influence on stopping youth using their cell phones all the time is their parents.  According to NPR’s Jennifer Ludden, “parents are trying a variety of ways, from monitoring content to limiting the time of day or number of minutes children may talk or text. Many parents surveyed (62 percent) say they have taken away their child's cell phone as punishment, though this can backfire: Parents often give children cell phones to keep track of their whereabouts, and don't like giving up that easy access.”  Other parents have the Wi-Fi set to turn off at night.  Although it will be difficult for some people to learn to not use their phone as a social crutch, it will hopefully help ease people back into communicating person to person more.  This proposal needs to be taken into deep consideration so that key communicative skills are not lost in today’s generation but also in future generations.</p>
