		<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
		<p>Over the course of this semester my writing skills have deeply developed.  We have written several pieces, each of which have been developing unique skills for me as a writer.  Along with the many pieces we have written there have been assignments that have also made me a better researcher, writer and interviewer.  Being able to do all of these things are very critical in life, and this class has continued the development of these skills by completing four major projects.  The four projects were each unique in their own ways.  They each had different purposes and assignments that we completed alongside them throughout the semester.  The four projects were the learned experience project, the cultural analysis proposal, the formal research project, and the multimedia remix project.  This will discuss each assignment and how they developed different skills.</p>
		<p>The first assignment that we had was the learned experience project.  The goal of this assignment was to identify a piece of technology that led you to choosing your major.  This assignment made me dig deep and think about the reason why I decided on the major I have chosen.  We began this assignment with a draft, and there were several questions for us to answer.  This was the beginning of thinking about what technology led you to choosing your major.  The last question was to compose an outline of what you plan your paper to look like, and we submitted this to D2L for our peers to read.  When you are reading your peers work yourself try very hard to actually give them good feedback.  You have to remember that this is the first time that they are taking a writing class in college too.  The feedback from this small group was all you got, so make sure you take what other people said about your piece into consideration because they are usually just trying to help make yours better.  When you are writing your paper make sure to have a strong purpose.  I wrote my paper on how the planes that crashed into the Twin Towers, changed my life forever, and led me to wanting to become a criminal justice major.  The purpose of my paper was to show how that entire event from my siblings and I getting pulled out of school, to my dad working late for weeks cleaning up the destruction shaped me into the person I am today.  My audience for this paper would be people in the criminal justice field because it would be something to talk about as to why we all got into the field we work.  This assignment made me really think about what events have happened in my life, and how they have shaped me into choosing criminal justice as my major.</p>
		<p>The second paper that we wrote was the cultural analysis report.  This purpose of this assignment was, through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to investigate a specific social issue and the effects that it has had on society.  The purpose of my report was to show how cell phones affected the social skills of people within society.  I chose to do my report on cell phones after we watched the episode of South Park in class.  The episode made me think about common everyday things that we use that I would be able to write a report on.  Just like the previous lived experiences project, we turned in our draft for our peers to edit.  Many of them liked what they read, so I knew I had a good topic to write my report on.  The audience of my report was society in general.  The use of cell phones affect everyone, not only a specific group of people.  While writing this paper I had to sift through websites, and other resources to find useful and credible information.  It further developed my reading and comprehension skills because it forced me to understand what I was reading, and decide if it was good information to include in my report.  Throughout this project I learned a lot about both the positive and negative aspects of cell phone usage, and was able to use them in report so that society, or whoever reads the report, can better understand the effects cell phones have on the world.</p>
		<p>The third project that we had to do was the formal research project.  In this project the purpose was to have you take your major and do research on what research goes on within the field.  While doing the research this project developed my skills as a researcher because I had to find useful information to include about research done within criminal justice, and what information would just clutter the paper with too many facts.  I mainly used the ProQuest database after it was introduced to us in the library activity.  The library activity is where I first got ideas as to what I wanted to research, and also helped me determine the questions that I wanted to ask in my interview.  I disliked this project the most because it was hard to figure out where to even begin, and it was also, in my opinion, the most work.  This project helped develop my interview skills because we had to conduct an interview with someone that works and does research within your academic discipline.  I was able to get a first-hand perspective of what goes on, not only working within the discipline, but also how they do research within the discipline.  During this project you learn a great deal about the major you chose.  The audience of this research paper could be either people interested in going into the field of criminal justice, or people that are not in the criminal justice field, but are trying to understand what they do.  For someone thinking about going into criminal justice this paper can educate them on what research goes on within criminal justice, and provides them with a perspective of someone that has worked in criminal justice for many years.  For people that are just simply interested in criminal justice this research paper will help them understand everything that goes on within the field of criminal justice.</p>
		<p>The last project that we just most recently completed was the multimedia remix project.  This project was very much unlike the others we had done in the class so far.  This project was not only a group project, but it also had us compose a documentary taking one of our previous papers, and making it come to life in a visual way.  When choosing your topic for your documentary choose one that will most easily be turned into a video.  The purpose of this project was to learn how to work in a group, and be able to take your paper, in our case the cultural analysis project, and have it get the same point across but in a completely different way.  During this project we worked on our research skills, and also developed our writing skills by writing a proposal as a group.  We each did a different part of the proposal, and we then had to make them merge together so that it would sound fluid and not choppy.  When doing this project communication is key.  It is college and everyone is on different schedules, but you all need to make time so that you can record and edit your video on time.  A group chat on our phones, and on Google Drive allowed us to be able to communicate more easily.  The audience for this project was once again society in general.  Because we did our documentary on the affects that cell phones have on society, the audience has to be the society of which you are referring too.  As previously stated, cell phones have had many effects both positive and negative on society, and informing people of these effects will make the society more educated, and will hopefully help with the solution to the issues with cell phones.</p>
		<p>Throughout this semester we have completed four major projects.  Each project was unique and helped develop/teach different skills along the way.  The lived experiences project made you really think about why you chose the major that you did, and what events in your life led you to it.  The cultural analysis project had you take a cultural artifact and determine what social issue it has had on society, which in my case was how cell phones have affected society.  The research project developed our research and interview skills as we researched about the research done within our academic discipline.  The final project, the multimedia remix project, had us work on our teamwork skills as well as learning to get your point across to an audience in a different visual way than the original project which was writing a paper.  Each of these projects developed different skills, and had you think about your major in a different way than you had ever done before.</p>
