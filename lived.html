		<h1>September</h1>
		<p>Throughout childhood we are always asked one question.  It is the same question, over and over again.  What do you want to be when you grow up?  Automatically kids reply with answers like astronaut, doctor, and police officer.  These are great answers, but when kids are growing up and they say these professions they don’t know about the events and technologies around them that will affect them forever.  Technology is a major part of everyone’s life.  The good and the bad, there is no escaping the influence it has on you.  The events that happen in your life will never be forgotten, and especially now because you can just look it up on your computer.  Technology also has its drawbacks.  People misuse technology every day, and sometimes this misused technology has detrimental effects on people.  The misuse of technologies around us affect us for the rest of our lives.</p>
		<p>Being a criminal justice major people are always curious as to why I decided to go into that field.  September 11th, 2001, that’s why.  At the time I lived in northern New Jersey, and the misuse of the planes during the 9/11 attack is a major example of misused technology that had a detrimental effect on the people in New York City and all over the country, myself included.  Everyone old enough remembers that particular day.  All of the horrific events that led up to one of the worst things to happen to America since Pearl Harbor.  Two planes that took off from different locations, and crashed into the twin towers, and caused an unthinkable destruction of one of the world’s most famous cities.  These planes had been hijacked by a group of terrorists, and majorly impacted my life forever.   Being in first grade, I barely understood what was going on at the time except that I could sense that something was wrong.  Everyone kept getting called out of class, and we all thought it was super funny until my brother, sister, and I were called out of school by a family friend, and she looked frantic.  We went over to her house and didn’t hear from my parents for hours.  My mom returned home much later than usual because my dad worked in Manhattan in 2001, and he was on his way to work when he saw the plane hit the second tower.  Being a member of the DEA he was expected to help clean up the destruction at what is now called Ground Zero.  I remember him coming home late at night covered in soot, and going straight to the shower before we could see just how filthy he was.  I remember that for weeks all they played on TV was about the attack.  And I mean that is all they played.  Every station on TV was talking about it at all times, and there was only one station that kids could watch so that we did not have to be exposed to the tragedy around us.  Nickelodeon was that station.  I don’t know if they were ever complimented or thanked, but as of now I am thanking them.  Thank you for trying to protect my innocence the best you could, even though it was not very successful.  Nickelodeon at that time was an example of a technology used in a beneficial way, in the midst of all the negative talk on the news.  This was the case for several weeks, and it changed me forever.</p>
		<p>Looking back on it now, the misuse of the planes in 9/11 is how I decided what I wanted to do when I grew up.  I have never really recovered from everything I witnessed that year in New York, but I have definitely learned from it.  In December of 2001 my family and I went to a Broadway show because they gave discounted tickets to all fireman and police officers in the city for all of their hard work, and all I remember is that New York was not as busy as I had always known it.  People were afraid to come to the city because they didn’t know if we were going to be attacked again.  Many other things besides the amount of people walking around Times Square Garden changed in the country after that day.  Security in every airport escalated to the point that you had to remove your shoes, and still to this day is as extreme as it was right after 9/11.  It is hard to decide if this is a good thing.  Of course it’s good in the sense that we are keeping American people more safe on planes, but aren’t they a little paranoid?  You can’t bring onto a plane more than 3.4 ounces of liquid, but it is ok because you can bring your ice skates on the plane as a carry on.  Doesn’t this seem a little ridiculous?  And yet this is what America did in response to the attack, and I do not see anything changing in the near future, which shows how the misuse of this technology one time changed the future of it forever.</p>
		<p>A few kids at my school lost a parent in the attack on that morning in New York City.  I do not think any child, or adult for that matter, should ever have to go through that.  I want to protect and help people in our country so they do not have to go through what I went through.  The most vivid memories I have are the ash floating through the sky and landing on my street, the blood on my dad’s hands, and New York City around me virtually empty.  People ask me why I want to major in criminal justice.  Well the scene full of helpless chaos I just described to you is exactly why.  This story proves how misused technology has lasting effects on people.  It happened over twelve years ago when I was a child, and I still remember what happened that day.  Chaos, fear, and destruction are words of how I would describe it to you.</p>
		<p>That one question we are asked as kids is what we think about up until we walk across that stage on graduation day, and even then some of us are still unsure about what we want to do for the rest of our lives.  It is one of the, if not the biggest, decision we make in our entire life.  It defines who we are, and even if we are unsure, it leads us in the direction we will take during our adulthood.  Little do we know that along those eighteen years of thinking about what we want to do, the smallest technologies have been influencing the decision that we make when we decide “what we want to be when we grow up.”  The negative and positive technologies shape you into who you are.  For me it was the American and United Airline flights that crashed into the Twin Towers.  The attack changed me and now that I am older and am able to reflect back on that miserable day, I realize that I will never recover, but I can try my best to make sure my country doesn’t have to go through anything like that ever again.</p>
