			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Along with the ability to communicate, technology plays a crucial role in criminal justice.  Technology within the criminal justice system includes cell phones, computer databases, cars, weapons, police radios, radar guns, cameras, and many more.  Technology is so important because it allows the entire process of criminal justice to speed up.  Technology also allows law enforcement officials easier access to old cases, and even police records on criminals/potential criminals.  Cell phones have also helped the criminal justice system become more efficient.  The use of cell phones in criminal justice has provided an easier way to communicate with people.  It allows police partners to give each other a quick call instead of having to use the radio.  Cell phones also have helped criminal justice advance because there are so many pictures being taken on them everywhere they go that it is helpful to identify possible criminals or witnesses at a crime scene if someone accidentally took a picture of them on their phone.  The advance in technology has also allowed police to be able to get places much more quickly by using cars.  Police officers that have the access to a car are clearly much more effective than an officer that does not have a car because with a car police officers are capable of patrolling a much greater area than those without a car.  Police officers also monitor other people using this technology by using radar guns to try and prevent the abuse of the speed of cars on outrageous and unsafe levels.  Gun technology and other forms of weapons are also used in criminal justice.  Guns provide law enforcement officials with a last resort to protect themselves.  Although some people may disagree with law enforcement carrying guns, it provides safety for the people protecting the streets.  Another technology used widely in the criminal justice field is the computer.  It is used on both the state and local level, and there is one located in almost every patrol car.  The criminal justice system also uses court approved phone/wiring taping, and also computer activities whether live or historical.  All of these types of technologies have advanced the efficiency of the criminal justice field in some way, shape, or form.</p>
