			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Communication is one of the most important aspects within the field of criminal justice.  Drug Enforcement Administration agent Tim Plancon says that, “Every single type of communication is used within law enforcement.  Obviously verbal and non-verbal communication are extremely important forms of communication that are used every day within the field of criminal justice.  Along with those verbal and non-verbal communication skills, written is probably one of the most underrated types of communication that is used in law enforcement.  You have to be able to effectively tell the story of exactly what happened in detail on your report otherwise the person will not be able to be prosecuted, and it will have all been for nothing.”   Being able to effectively write in law enforcement is crucial.  It is a necessity to be able to effectively do the job.  Examples of written communication are e-mails all the way up to formal report writing.  In formal report writing this is where law enforcement officials use all the data that they have collected to provide evidence for a case to prosecute a potential criminal.  They have to be able to explain in depth, the different aspects of the investigation, how they were obtained, and what they mean.  Written communication is a key aspect in criminal justice.</p>
<p>Like previously stated verbal communication skills are also very important aspects of law enforcement.  These skills are also known as interpersonal skills, or the skills used to interact with other people every day.  “Law enforcement has a bureaucratic organizational structure, with many rules and procedures that exhibit little or no integration and little room for interpretation.  Hence, accurate and clear communication is important so that law enforcement officials can act and respond appropriately to situations (Strader, 2009).”  This means that law enforcement officials need to have strong verbal and non-verbal communication skills to work in the criminal justice field.  Verbal communication within this field are things like interviewing witnesses, potential criminals, or convicted criminals.  These interviews are important because it allows the law enforcement officials to collect evidence, and conduct research on whatever topic or case they are working on.  Verbal communication also takes place when law enforcement interacts with the general public.  According to the FBI, “Effective policing occurs when officers and members of the public partner to create safe and crime-free communities. This partnership requires that officers display not only strong technical capabilities but interpersonal skills. Therefore, law enforcement agencies must train their officers on how to interact effectively with the public.”  If law enforcement officials are not able to effectively communicate with the general public, then they will not have respect, and it will be far more difficult to obtain all of the information that they need when conducting interviews, or collecting statements from witnesses.</p> 
<p>The other side of verbal communication is non-verbal communication.  Non-verbal communication is when law enforcement officials are studying people’s body language.  They study non-verbal cues that can help them to determine different reactions of human beings.  For instance, law enforcement officials can generally tell when people are lying to them.  Also, street cops are often able to tell when a person is about to flee the scene.  They use body cues to survey a family’s reaction to a husband being arrested, and the potential for a wife attacking an officer or retribution in general.  Police officers use verbal and non-verbal cues continuously throughout their day.  According to Strader, “law enforcement officers’ actions and responses to environmental conditions are a direct reflection on the climate of society as a whole.”  How law enforcement officials communicate, whether it be verbal or non-verbal, reflect society greatly, and that is why having strong communication skills is very important within the field of criminal justice.</p>
