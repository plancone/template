		<h1>Memo</h1>
	    <h2>Composing in Context</h2>
	      <p>We chose cell phones as our topic for our documentary.  Choosing this topic affected our project because the distractions that cell phones impose allowed us to find many people constantly on and using their cell phones.  While we composed our documentary it helped me better understand the issue with cell phones and how serious their distraction is.  While we created our documentary we did run into a few problems.  Because we are all on different schedules and are constantly busy, it proved to be a challenge on when our group would be able to meet.  The audience plays an important role for our video because we really were aiming to really get them emotionally interested because of how serious the issue is.</p>
	    <h3>Process</h3>
	      <p>The process of selecting our group’s topic was the easiest part.  We all agreed on doing a cultural artifact, and collectively we decided that cell phones would be the most interesting topic.  The most challenging part of this project for me was where we needed to start.  This was difficult because I have never done a project like this before, and I was unsure how to begin putting a video together.  I would say we kind of took a systematic approach while doing this project.  Each week we would decide what every person was going to do for the next class, but we never really created guidelines on what exactly we were going to be doing throughout the entire project.</p>
	    <h4>Research</h4>
	      <p>The most beneficial research resources we used were videos about cell phones.  From commercials to other documentaries, videos are what provided us with inspiration and information on what we were going to do for our own documentary.  On the other hand, the least beneficial research resource that we used was looking up pictures of cell phones.  It seemed like a good idea at the time, but in the end provided no useful information that we could really use.</p>
	    <h5>Collaboration</h5>
	      <p>Throughout this project my group communicated through a group chat on our cell phones, and on a google document which allowed all of our information to be in one place.  We split up most of the work, and everyone always completed their part of the assignment.  We worked well together, and the project was successfully completed.  This project as a group project was both beneficial and not beneficial.  It was beneficial because there was a lot of work to be done, and working in a group splits that work up.  On the other hand, group projects in college are always a hassle.  Like previously stated it was a challenge to find when everyone would be able to meet up.  It was also annoying because some of my group didn’t come to class or would just sit there and not do anything.</p>
	    <h6>Project Management</h6>
	      <p>We planned our work pretty well for this documentary.  We split most of the work up, and everything we needed to get done eventually was completed.  If we had more time or if we were able to do the project all over again I would have gotten our group a different camera to use.  The one we used was fine except that it was similar to a Go-Pro, so you weren’t able to see what you were filming.</p>
	    <h7>Documentary Design</h7>
	      <p>The most effective aspect of our documentaries design is that we do not only show the positive aspects of the use of cell phones, but we also show the negative aspects of using cell phones.  This is the most effective aspect because it doesn’t just try to persuade you to believe that smart phones are good or that smart phones are bad, it gives you the information and lets you decide.  Our design decisions were mostly made by Rohit for the video because he was the only person that already knew how to make videos.</p>
