			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>When I was young, I used to call my friend’s house to see if she wanted to play outside.  When I hit the 8th grade, I got my first texting cell phone, and almost never made a call to see if she wanted to play again.  I just shot a text over to her, and shortly after we met each other outside.  When I got my cell phone it changed the way I communicated with everyone else around me.  It had caused me to talk on the phone less because I just told people to text me instead of calling.  I found it more convenient, but now as I have done more and more research on the subject of cell phones, I am glad that I still talk to people in person and on the phone on a regular basis.  Cell phones have captivated the people of our country for several years now.  Their popularity keeps increasing and it increased even more when the first smart phone came out on the market.  They surround us everywhere we go, and most people feel incomplete without their cell phone in their hand or pocket.  Cell phones have had several advantages like quick communication and easy access to information on the internet, but cell phones have also had many disadvantages.  They have led to the misuse of internet information, and most importantly the decline of interpersonal skills in our society.</p>
