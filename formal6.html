			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>The field of criminal justice relies on research to shape and influence an ever changing, complex system.  According to Timothy Plancon, who is an Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the Drug Enforcement Administration and has worked in criminal justice for 22 years, “Technology and crimes are constantly changing.  Anywhere from drug trafficking to credit card fraud to normal human trafficking.  Every time we find a way to detect illegal activity criminals eventually/typically find a way around it.”  Plancon who has also been conducting research off and on in the field of criminal justice for the past 18 years continues to explain that, “Criminal justice also uses various investigative and enforcement techniques to conduct research.  Anywhere from having to put hands on people to having to use a Taser on them.  From less deadly to deadly force. Research is needed constantly in law enforcement and criminal justice because criminals are sometimes very crafty and intuitive, and can find their way around detection from the government, and will continue to commit crimes in a new way.”  Plancon being a very reliable government agent, and also a continuous researcher, shows how research is very important in the field of criminal justice.  Law enforcement officials have shared information among agencies to help combat an ever evolving criminal component in our country.</p>
<p>One such area where research is used in criminal justice is when law enforcement officials want to locate criminals.  In order to locate criminals, law enforcement officials use computer data bases, they interview people, and they conduct physical research.  An example of physical research would be surveillance so that they can watch what the person does, but also it allows them to see who the person knows or talks to.  Plancon states that “court approved wire taping and computer activities whether live or historical are key in locating criminals.”  Additionally law officials use state motor vehicle computer data bases to locate people of interest and/or criminals, they do this by looking up driving records for known addresses.  Research done within the criminal justice field is much different than many other fields because research has to do with more person to person interactions than many other disciplines.  For example, law enforcement officials interview potential witnesses at a crime scene, and use this research to piece together what happened at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Additionally research is used to ‘profile’ criminals.  However, according to Tim Plancon, “We do not profile anyone. That became a bad word, and we can’t judge people so vaguely like that.  We do however use research to alert us of potential criminals.  We use a lot of physical surveillance or physical research.  We look at crime stats, and high crime areas.  We also use a program called Com Stat that is used to pinpoint where high crime areas are, and where more robberies, rapes, and murders take place.”  These are types of research conducted by law enforcement to better understand who is committing crimes, and what areas are more prone to crime.  Without research law enforcement would not be very successful because they would not learn from what they have seen before in previous cases.  They use this type of data to develop characteristics and understandings of criminals, and to understand why and where they act how they do.</p>

<p>Research in the field of criminal justice also uses something called Evidence Based Decision Making or EBDM for short.  Through Evidence Based Decision Making knowledge is shared.  Evidence Based Decision Making helps local and federal agencies create more effective judicial policies within areas.  “The National Institute of Corrections initiated a cooperative agreement beginning in 2008 to test the links between the application of evidence-based human and organizational change principles and the measurable reduction of key criminal justice outcomes, such as pretrial misconduct and post-conviction reoffending (Eville, 2010).”  The intent of this initiative is to provide criminal justice policy makers in local communities with informational tools and processes that have helped reduce pretrial misconduct as well as post-conviction reoffending.  Certain rates of crimes judicial processing and incarceration are analyzed as to why certain communities have a lower percentage of people that reoffend after they get out of prison.  The reason could be that systems have a better public prosecutor that does not let anything go, and is dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s put in first part by getting through the legal system.  More importantly these successful systems have established proven and effective methods for successful incarceration.  From the initial prosecution EBDM is used to show the most effective ways to prosecute criminals.  Additionally, some reasons that in some areas convicted felons reoffend less often could be that the jails track them better after they are released.  They are able to use the ankle trackers to pinpoint where the people on probation are at all times.  This is a constant reminder to someone on probation or parole that they may go back to jail or prison if they do not behave appropriately and make solid choices.  Finally, EBDM looks at what is going on in prisons and jails across the country.  It looks at the types of programs available to prisoners while in prison, or when they get out.  This could be receiving job training or education while in prison.  EBDM is obtained through current and credible research collected from a variety of sources.  These sources include verbal and non-verbal communications observed and recorded in both law enforcement officials, criminals, and potential criminals.  This Evidence Based Decision Making research is very important within the field of criminal justice, and law enforcement, and it has only recently been incorporated leading to many more answers about reoffending prisoners then the criminal justice system ever had before.</p>
