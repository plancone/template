			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Cell phones have changed the world around us.  As a society we are unsure if this is a good thing because although there are positives to being in the possession of a cell phone like quick communication and easy access to the internet, there are also negatives aspects.  “The average person checks their phone 110 times a day and up to every 6 seconds in the evening (Woollaston, 2013).”  People check their phones so often that it is causing the decline of social skills.  According to the Pew Research Center in June of 2013, cell phone ownership has hit up to 91% of adults in America and 78% of teens. That is a large portion of the population, and if that many people are in possession of something then it is going to change the way our society runs.  However, the drawback of cell phones is that my generation and the generations that come after me are progressively getting worse at communication skills.  We are too busy texting, tweeting, and snap chatting, to actually go over to someone’s house and have a real face to face conversation.  “On average teens send 50 texts a day and a large portion send more than that (Ludden).”  Like I mentioned in the beginning of this paper, I began to text my friend to come outside instead of walking over to her front door, and asking her in person.  This uncommunicative behavior also occurs in many other places.  When people are in public they tend to ignore each other to avoid awkward situations, and so they do not have to socialize with new people in general.  It is sad that at traditional social situations such as sitting on a bus, at a party, or even at dinner, people pull out their phones to use as a crutch to avoid social interaction.  Cell phones are decreasing youth’s social skills, and because social skills are so important it is a major issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
