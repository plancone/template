			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>During present day, people’s entire lives revolve around the use of their cell phone.  During my latest Sociology lecture my professor said, “Sometimes you guys make me laugh.  I just watch you all every day, and most of you treat your cell phone like it is your own child.”  Our class chuckled, but he is completely correct.  Since the very first cell phone call in 1973 made by the inventor of cell phones himself, Martin Cooper, cell phones have become heavily used and a humongous industry.  Smart phones in particular, have become popular and people, teenagers in particular, have progressively become less social because of them, and people have turned to their cell phone to kill time, and a lot of people struggle to put their phone down even for the length of a car ride.  In fact, some people are so obsessed with their cell phone that they text while they drive.  Driving already contains many distractions that you need to try to ignore, but to voluntarily text someone while driving instead of waiting another five minutes when you arrive at your destination shows how some people just cannot survive without their cell phone.  They put their own life in danger just to text someone back when that person will still be there a few minutes later.  In some ways, however, cell phones have become an extreme advantage and have benefited people in many ways.  It has allowed the ability of people to have faster communication, entertainment, and a way to remind them to do certain tasks, look up homework, and even capture the moment (pictures).  There are many positives and negatives of cell phone usage, and they have only become more and more popular since they first came out.</p>
