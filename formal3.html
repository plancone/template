			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Criminal justice is a system of law enforcement that is directly involved in apprehending, prosecuting, defending, sentencing, and punishing those who are suspected or convicted of criminal offenses. The criminal justice system is comprised of local and federal agencies and the processes established by these institutions to monitor and control crime through imposing penalties on people who break set laws.  The criminal justice system in the United States is composed of many similar, individual systems, and it is key to the running of the country.  The criminal justice system works within wherever the charge has taken place: city, county, state, or federal government.  Each of these distinct institutions has different set laws that can overlap, but sometimes do not.  Moreover, areas within our country have different laws, agencies, and ways of dealing with the criminal justice system.  The fact that we have so many distinct law enforcement entities often causes complex and ineffective judicial systems.  However, in recent years there has been an emphasis on using evidence based and other types of research to help shape and influence a more proficient body of systems.</p>
