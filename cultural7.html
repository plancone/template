			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Interpersonal skills are the life skills we use every day to communicate and interact with other people.  You can see by this definition of interpersonal skills that they are very important skills that everyone needs to have and we cannot afford people in our society to lose them.  Having interpersonal skills is what runs our society.  The ability to be able to communicate and get along with people that surround you is very important because if people are not able to communicate with others then you do not have the fundamentals you need in order to be successful.  Everyone needs communication skills so that our country can run efficiently.  Otherwise, we could end up like the citizens in Wall-E that just sit there all hours of the day using what is almost exactly like a future of the modern day smart phone.  It is just a cartoon, but it depicts what our society could turn into if people no longer possess these necessary skills.  As a society we need to work on teaching the youth of today to start relying less on the use of their cell phones and to start communicating more with the people that surround them like how people used to.  Cell phones have affected people’s interpersonal skills, but it’s not too late to help people get them back.</p>
